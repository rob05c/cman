# cman
Cman (for Cheatsheet Man) displays a handy cheetsheet for terminal commands.

It displays cheatsheet info specified in JSON files (see the included curl.json example), inspired by http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2015/09/16/a-curl-cheat-sheet/.

It currently displays your terminal colors inverted, but it can be trivially changed to any color you like.

The app is pure Go, with no external dependencies (such as ncurses).

It dynamically fits cheatsheets to your terminal width.

Pull requests for json cheatsheets of other terminal apps are welcome!
